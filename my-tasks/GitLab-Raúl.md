## Commands ##

Work using what you learned so far, explain git basic commands and its main flags/options:

clone: It is used to obtain a copy of an existing repository, or if you want to contribute from another location, this command is also used.

pull: The command to download the content from the remote repository is used to, later, immediately update the local repository so that this content is reflected.

push: This is used so that all content can be uploaded from a local repository to a remote repository.

add: This is used so that a change of the working directory can be made within the staging environment.

commit: When this command is used, all the changes that have been made for that point in the project are captured.

merge: With this command you can take the lines that are independent of development that were made in "git branch" to join them into a single branch.

rebase: Thanks to the use of this command we are given the possibility to change what was created, using a reference point within the list of commits.

status: This allows us to observe the state of the staging environment, along with the working directory and the changes that have been made within the project.

log: This command is used to check the history of the repository, when you want to examine the changes that will be made when a branch is merged or also to see some specific version.

checkout: Finally, this last command allows us to navigate through the branches created by using "git branch", meaning that with this option it allows us to change the branch to go directly to another.

## Differences between commands ##

Difference between add and commit: Both commands have different functions, but at the same time they are related to each other, because in the add command it is used so that the snapshot data can be typed in the cache area and, on the other hand, the commit is used to that the contents of the cache can be added into the storage.

Difference between merge and rebase: The main variance with this two is that the rebase command is used to be able to join the branches, making the graph look more linear, while, on the contrary, the merge still keeps the branch graph as it is.
