1. To get started, go to the Sprint 2 folder within the GitHub app

2. The space that said “Main activity” was located to find the instructions requested by this first activity and they were carefully reviewed to understand what had to be done

3. For this part, the "Visual Code Studio" application was opened for the development of the activity code

4. The displayed YAML code was copied and pasted into the activity, without a single change being made

5. The terminal was opened to do the "push" and save the changes

6. In order to better carry out this next part of the activity, a file containing the syntax was revised to support

7. The name of the job was changed to "Docker-Build-Demo" and later the code was made to only respond to pushes made by the master branch

8. The steps were added so that the docker images that were made in the previous activity can be created

9. Later, exactly the same was done for the other services, changing only certain parts so that they are consistent with what each one is

10. It was verified that if each of the points requested in the activity had been fulfilled, verifying that nothing was missing

11. Finally, the "push" was made inside the terminal so that the changes were saved
