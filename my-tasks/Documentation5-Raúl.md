1. To get started, I went to the Sprint 4 folder inside the GitHub app

2. The space that said “Main Activity” was located to find the instructions requested for this activity and they were carefully reviewed to understand what had to be done

3. Created the Azure Container Registry along with the Kubernetes Cluester

4. The "terraform plan" command was run so that I could connect the cluster created with kubectl

5. The "Docker login" commands were run in the ACR, to later push the images inside the container

6. I went to the link provided by the activity to locate the manifest code that will be used for the following points

7. A new directory called "helm-chart" was created, where the manifests from the previous point were added

8. Once the lines of code have been entered, change the link of the "images" part, replacing it with the links of the images pushed in the ACR

9. I created my Helm Chart in the helm-chart directory, to then create the helm pipeline based on the requirements indicated in the last point of the activity

10. The documentation was made in order to have a record of what was done during the activity
