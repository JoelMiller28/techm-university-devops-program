1. To get started, go to the Sprint 1 folder within the GitHub app

2. The space that said "Main Activity" was located to find the instructions requested by this first activity and they were carefully reviewed to understand what exactly had to be done

3. Two different dockerfiles were created, which one was for the recommendation service, and the other one for the email service

4. For this part, the "Visual Code Studio" application was opened for the development of the code for the activity

5. In order to better carry out this activity, a file was revised containing the necessary commands to carry out operations, serving as support when writing the code

6. We started first with the Recommendation service, where the commands that were provided were run, in addition to copying the requirements.txt and putting the entrypoints

7. Later, almost the same thing was done with the Email service, but with the instructions that were requested

8. It was checked that each of the points requested in the activity had been fulfilled, verifying that no steps had been skipped

9. The necessary modifications and changes were made for the code to work (there was a mistake with both files, where things were mixed by accident)

10. Finally, the file was uploaded to the place of delivery to be able to conclude the activity

11. The documentation was made in order to have a record of what was done during the activity.
