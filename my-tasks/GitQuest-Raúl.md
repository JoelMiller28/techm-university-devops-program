# Git Quest #

1. What is the difference between Git, Github and Gitlab?

    ### Git ###

        Is a distributed version control system that is responsible for registering the versions of the same file, where the user is allowed to manage any of the registered versions at any time.

    ### Github ###

        Is cloud-based, being an online service where developers can upload code repositories to store it in the Git version control system.

    ### Gitlab ###

        Is a project management repository with a web interface, this tool provides us with the code to generate a server and manage the services and options that are offered.


2. Explain why Git can be used by a development team without need of platforms such as Github or Gitlab.

    Because Git gives users the ability to have files changed simultaneously by multiple people, without the fear that the changes might be altered by other people.

3. Besides being useful as a SCM, what influence does git has in the industry?

    This tool has been relevant because it has been devised to enable the labeling and branching of processes of primary importance, in addition to being widely used due to the advantages it has, being very fast to carry out processes, it works with branches, it is a fairly complex, free software that does not depend on a central repository, etc.

    We cannot forget its **main characteristics**, mentioning that this tool is considered as a *source code manager*, an *efficient web browser* and a *powerful code editor* capable of performing operations effectively.

4. Mention some control version software besides Github.

    Another system that can be used is **SVN**. This software has the advantage that it´s very easy to use and manage, has good GUI tools like TortoiseSVN, empty directories, and Windows support it´s better compared to Github, among other features.

5. What options do you have to initialize a repo? (CLI and GUI)

    You have to use the "git init" command, this is used only once within the initial configuration of a new repository. When this command is executed, it will be creating a new .git subdirectory in the current working directory, also creating a new main branch.

6. Tell us why are branches important.

    Branches are part of the development process, where they are a pointer to a snapshot of the changes that have been made. Whenever you want to add some new function or make some correction, you will have to generate a new branch to record what you´ve made, no matter how big or small that is.

7. Explain the difference between the working directory, the staging area and the remote repository.

    The **working directory** is where the database for the project and a copy of a version of that project are stored. 

    In the **staging area** files will be saved temporarily and will allow us to save the changes made. 

    Finally, the **remote repositories** are versions of the project that are hosted on the network, where they will have read-only or read-write permissions.

8. Explain what is a Branching Model and describe how it would you use it if your team wants to add 3 features to one application.

    A Git branching model defines the branching strategy in Git, defining how developers make modifications or changes and commit them back to their code base. Thanks to this model, the feedback process for developers can be accelerated.

    In the other hand, what can be done in order to add three functions in the application, is by using the "git merge new-branch" command, where these functions can be joined to the base code within the same project.

9. How do we avoid updating autogenerated files and environment information to a remote repository.

    There are two ways to do this: The first option is to use the ".gitignore" command, or else exclude the file, in order to ignore changes made within the software
